# External Research

Delegate an external-scout subagent using the `agent` tool to perform web search for planning purpose.

Do not use this step to solve problems that are to be solved during plan execution, but rather to inform planning decisions.

## Hard Rules (violating any = task failure)

1. Always write your prompt as instructions *to* external-scout, not about external-scout. Treat it as a message to another agent.
2. Always write structured prompts, not a dense block of text. Use formatting, lists, and sections to make the prompt easy to parse.
3. Always instruct external-scout how you want it to report back (e.g. structure, content, what to exclude, etc.)
4. Never ask external-scout to search things like specific implementation details, API/user docs, etc. Instead leverage this step to survey the landscape of options regarding external resources that can be decided on during plan execution.

## Preflight Checklist

1. Call `qdrant_qdrant-find` using `collection_name={{PLAN_NAME}}` and query "user goal and request".
2. Call `qdrant_qdrant-find` using `collection_name={{PLAN_NAME}}` and query "user involvement and constraints".
3. Call `qdrant_qdrant-find` using `collection_name={{PLAN_NAME}}` to refresh findings from the project orientation in the previous step. Decide on 3-5 queries and call the tool for each one.

```toml
[preflight]
user_goal_and_request = <summarize the user's overall goal and specific request in one sentence>
external_research_need = <true/false, is external research needed to inform planning decisions?>
subagent_type = external-scout
description = <3-5 word summary of the delegation's purpose — e.g., "web search landscape survey">
topics_and_questions = <decide on topics and questions you want external-scout to survey>
constraints_and_involvement = <summarize any constraints on the project and the user's desired level of involvement in one sentence>
report_format = <decide on the format and content for the external-scout's report response>
goal_driven_delegation_prompt = <true/false sanity check>
```

## Delegation Protocol

If `external_research_need=false`, you may call `agent` instructing `external-scout` that no research is needed and it can return immediately, but only after confirming with the user.

1. Decide how you want to structure your prompt and what the content is. Leverage your preflight checklist.
2. Call the agent tool, filling in the `prompt` argument with the structured prompt you decided on. Use the preflight checklist to fill in `subagent_type` and `description` arguments.
3. Once external-scout responds, categorize the report into distinct notes. Call `qdrant_qdrant-store` for each distinct note using `collection_name={{PLAN_NAME}}`. Do not store as a monolithic note, this makes discoverability and parsing of notes more difficult.

## Gate

```toml
[gate]
findings = <findings surfaced by external-scout, summarized in your own words>
unknowns = <unknowns or gaps that remain after external-scout's survey, summarized in your own words>
qdrant_store_note_count = <N>
qdrant_collection_name_used = <collection name used in qdrant_qdrant-store calls>
gate_passed = <true/false> # false if your qdrant_qdrant-store calls were insufficient or you used the wrong collection name
```

If your gate checks revealed poor note taking, leading the `gate_passed = false`, correct that with additional calls to `qdrant_qdrant-store` before calling `next_step`. Do not call `next_step` until your gate checks are all satisfactory.

## How to Proceed

Call `next_step` once preflight checks, delegation and final gate have all been completed. Proceed immediately, do not wait for user instruction to proceed.
